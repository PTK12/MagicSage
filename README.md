# MagicSage

Want SageMath syntax highlighting? Look no further!

MagicSage adds SageMath support to [MagicPython](https://github.com/MagicStack/MagicPython) ❤️.

NOTE: MagicSage is an unofficial implementation of MagicPython for SageMath.

Differences:
- Raw numbers
- `sage:` and `....:` prompts
- Sage ellipsis
- `^^` as a logical operator
- `^` as an arithmetic operator

For information about Python, see the [original page](https://github.com/MagicStack/MagicPython).

## Problems

Backslash operators and implicit multiplication are currently unsupported.
MagicSage currently does not have extensions set up for VS Code, Atom or Sublime Text.
